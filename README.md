# CodeBreaker
This is an attempt to replicate the code breaking challenge in Fallout Games.


As it stands, the code only gives the player 10 chances to guess
It checks each individual letter after each guess to return a 1 if matching and 0 if not matching

IDK how to make the game pretty.
In the long run, I would like to make the user's input at mouse.click on a string that would be printed to the screen # goals
